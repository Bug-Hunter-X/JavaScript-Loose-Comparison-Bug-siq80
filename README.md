This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose comparison. The `foo` function intends to check for equality between two numbers, but it uses loose comparison (==), which can lead to unexpected results when comparing values of different types.  The solution showcases how to use strict equality (===) to resolve the issue and ensure type-safe comparisons.
